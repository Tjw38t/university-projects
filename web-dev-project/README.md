# Web Development Project
This directory contains the completed individual final project for my Web Development course: a website allowing users to sign in, view Dungeons and Dragons Spells, and add them to their profile.
The project was completed in Fall 2021, using the Brackets source code editor.
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQl to allow for deployment with a database on a web server.
