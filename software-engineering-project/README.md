# Software Engineering Project
This directory contains a link to the completed team final project for my Software Engineering course.
The project was completed in Fall 2021, with a team of four people including myself.
For this project, my team added API endpoints to the existing API of the Augur open source project, created OpenAPI documentation using Swagger, and hosted a version of Augur on a web server to demo the project. My team had four weeks to complete this (divided into four sprints) and we utilized an Agile Methodology to do so. My contribution to this project was writting the bulk of the project documentation, as well as completing the actual API endpoint development.
