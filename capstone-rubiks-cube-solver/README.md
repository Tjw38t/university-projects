# Capstone Project: Rubik's Cube Solving Application
This directory contains the completed documentation and source code for my team's Computer Science capstone project: a Rubik's Cube solving application.
The project was divided into two portions: planning and documentation, beginning in January 2022, and development beginning in August, 2022.
Included in this repository is the Design Documentation for the project, including research, design specifications, and development strategy.
Also included is the completed sourcecode for the developed application

In contribution to the documentation, I completed research regarding real-world methods of solving a Rubik's cube, identified which of these methods to implement, and provided design specifications, diagrams, and psuedocode for these methods.
In contribution to the development, I served as a backend developer, specifically contributing to the solving algorithms based on real-world methods.
