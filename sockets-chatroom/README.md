# Sockets Based Chatroom Project
This directory contains the completed sockets project for my Networking course: a socket based chatroom with a client and server.
The project was completed in Spring 2022.
For this project, C++ and the winsock2 library were used to create a simple chatroom application.
The application includes four commands for the client to send to the server:

``newuser <username> <password>``

``login <username> <password>``

``send <message>``

``logout``

Included in this directory is a screenshot demonstrating this project.
