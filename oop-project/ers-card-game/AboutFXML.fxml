It allows users to play the against a virtual opponent set to one of three difficulty options. Each difficulty setting will change how quickly the virtual opponent takes their next action.

The game begins with each player being dealt half the deck. Then one player (in this application you) begins the game by laying down a card face up without knowing what it is before-hand. Then the next player quickly lays down a card in the same way, and the players continue this going back and forth laying down cards. This continues until one of the patterns on the right appears in the pile. When a pattern appears, the players both have the option to “slap” the pile. If a player slaps the pile before their opponent slaps or lays down another card, the cards in the pile are added to the player’s hand. Be warned though, if you slap when it is illegal to do so, you will be penalized 1 card from your hand. Play continues until the game ends when one player runs out of cards in their hand. When this happens, the player who still has cards in their hand wins the game! " wrappingWidth="350.8525390625" />
