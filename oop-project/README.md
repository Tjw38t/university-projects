# Object Oriented Programming Project
This directory contains the completed individual final project for my Object Oriented Programming course: an application based on the card game ERS (meaning Egyptian Rat Screw or Slap).
The project was completed in Fall 2021, using the NetBeans 8.2 IDE.
Included in this directory are screenshots and source files for the project.

This ERS application was developed using a Model-View-Control methodology.
The application includes three modes of difficulty, multiple pages, and an automated opponent named Joshua (after the computer from *WarGames*).
The start function for the program can be found in the file titled "Tjw38tFinalProject.java".
